# Crime Analysis on Las Angeles Crime Dataset


For a long time, crime has been prevalent in society. It has a negative impact on society, both socially and economically. Crime analysis aids in identifying various patterns, insights, and trends in various types of crime. In this project, we looked at a real-world dataset of violent crime cases that occurred in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2020. We began with exploratory analysis on the data set to analyze the violent crime dataset for Los Angeles, followed by the ETL process. We analyzed the data using SQL queries, created a tableau visualization, and created an interactive dashboard. We gained insight into the type of crime, location, time, and socio-demographic characteristics of victims, as well as observed the violent crime trend over time. The insights will be useful for a resident or tourist who wants to learn more about the various safety aspects.
